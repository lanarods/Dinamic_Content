Working with Dynamic Content and Styles 
Midwest University
Norene Somerville is a professor of history at Midwest University.
One of her recent projects involves putting the text of important historic documents online for her students to download and study.
The Web site she’s creating will support a variety of different document formats, 
but Norene also wants each document to be available in HTML format on a single Web page.
This format makes it easier for students to print out the complete text of a document without having to navigate an entire site or 
install word processing or document software. However, Norene is concerned that some of the documents are very long and would be 
difficult to manage if placed on a single page. She believes that a table of contents that summarizes the different sections within 
a document and provides links to those sections would be a great aid to students. However, Norene doesn’t have the time to create 
such a table of contents for each document in her online library. She wants a program to automatically generate these tables of contents,
and she has asked you to develop such a utility.
